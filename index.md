<img class="profile-picture" src="0.jpeg">

David Venuto is a machine learning researcher and PhD student at Mila and McGill University.  He is also the Director of AI at Elucidate Solutions Inc.

For more info see my [GitHub](https://github.com/dvVenuto).

I am also an avid traveller and have visited 30 countries in addition to working in 4.  You can view my [Travel Map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_QtJdbULTcZpp6Jb8Da1D3T6d7vGn5np&usp=sharing).

## Research Interest

Reinforcement learning problems, kernel machines, and generative neural networks.
